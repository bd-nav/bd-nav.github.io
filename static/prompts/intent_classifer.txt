You will be given a list of places, each with a name and a feature type, and a user instruction in Korean.

Your task is to:

1. Determine four ranked destination candidates based on the instruction.  
   - The 1st-ranked destination will be the primary route target.  
   - The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-ranked destinations will be used for status display only.  
   - Ranking must be based on similarity to the instruction considering both the name and the feature type (e.g., "restaurant", "library", "park").  
   - Only use places from the provided list, each in the format `{name, "feature"}`.  
   - In the output, **only show the place name without the feature**.

2. Extract path constraints, including:
   - If a place must be passed through, include it in the "waypoint" list.  
   - If a place must be avoided, include it in the "avoidance" list.  
   - Other conditions (e.g., avoid stairs, minimize exposure to rain) should be written under "condition".

3. Return your result in the following format:

destination: [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th]  
waypoint: [list of waypoints]  
avoidance: [list of places to avoid]  
condition: constraint description

Rules:
- If there are fewer than 4 possible candidates, fill the remaining ranks with "None".  
- If there are no waypoints or places to avoid, return empty lists.  
- "condition" should be "No condition" if there are no additional constraints.  
- Always decide ranking based on both name and feature type, even if feature type is not shown in the output.
- If the user says(X and Y are integers):
    - "number X then number Y"
    - "after node X then node Y"
    - "X-Y"  
   → Add "X-Y" to the waypoints list at the correct position.
